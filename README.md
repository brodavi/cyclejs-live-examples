## cyclejs-live-examples

This is merely a collection of cyclejs components all crammed into one page. Why? To help me learn Cycle.js as well as testing the claim that "every single Cycle.js app ... is a function that can be reused in a larger Cycle.js app," which is apparently fairly true.

## Installation

git clone BLAH
npm install
npm start
